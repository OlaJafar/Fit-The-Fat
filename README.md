# Fit The Fat – Systems Analysis & Design (SAD)

This repository contains the full analysis and design for the **Fit The Fat** online gym platform. This project was developed as part of the **Systems Analysis and Design** course to show the technical documentation required before the coding phase.

## Project Overview
**Fit The Fat** is a digital health and fitness ecosystem. The goal of the system is to provide users with a complete experience, including workout videos, diet plans from professional doctors, an online store for gym equipment, and tracking through smartwatches.

## Analysis & Design Documentation
The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and includes detailed technical diagrams:

* **Use Case Diagrams:** To define the interactions between users, doctors, trainers, and the system.
* **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):** To map how data moves through the application (Level 0, Level 1, etc.).
* **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):** To design the database structure (Users, Doctors, Products, Orders, etc.).
* **Activity Diagrams:** To show the workflow of key features like booking a consultation or buying a product.
* **Data Dictionary:** Detailed descriptions of every data field used in the system tables.
* **Feasibility Study:** An analysis of the technical and operational success of the project.

## System Features
* **User Management:** Registration and profiles for users, trainers, and doctors.
* **Health Tracking:** Real-time data sync with Android smart devices.
* **E-Commerce:** A full system for browsing and purchasing gym supplies and supplements.
* **Consultations:** A bridge between users and professional doctors for personalized diet plans.
* **Content Streaming:** Access to fitness videos and motivational podcasts.

## Files Included
* **Fit The Fat Project.pdf**: The main document containing all the diagrams (Use Case, DFD, ERD, Activity Diagrams) and the Data Dictionary.
